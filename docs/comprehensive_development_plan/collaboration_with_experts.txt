This Python code defines a system for managing and engaging with experts during the development of the Elysium Marketplace. It includes classes for representing experts and managing collaborations, functions for initializing collaborations and engaging with experts, and example usage. The code assumes the existence of a JSON file (`experts_list.json`) containing expert details, which is used to load and save expert information. The `AIContentCreation` variable is a placeholder for the actual AI agent schema and should be replaced with the actual data structure used in the project.
