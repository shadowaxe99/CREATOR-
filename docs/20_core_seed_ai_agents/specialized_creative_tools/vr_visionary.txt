This code defines a `VRVisionaryAgent` class that uses a hypothetical `VRToolkit` to create and manage virtual reality experiences. The agent can create new experiences, refine them based on feedback, and manage a list of projects. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how to instantiate the agent, create a new VR experience, refine it, and retrieve project details.
