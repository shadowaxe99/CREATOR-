# Utility functions and models would be defined in their respective modules

# Example usage:
# db_connection = establish_db_connection()
# collaboration_catalyst = CollaborationCatalyst(db_connection)
# potential_collaborators = collaboration_catalyst.find_collaborators(user_id=123, project_id=456, required_skills=['Python', 'Machine Learning'])

This code snippet represents a Python class `CollaborationCatalyst` that facilitates the finding and initiating of collaborations within the Elysium Marketplace. It includes methods to find potential collaborators based on required skills and user preferences, and to initiate collaboration by sending invites. Utility functions and models are referenced and would be defined in their respective modules. The example usage demonstrates how to use the class with a database connection.
